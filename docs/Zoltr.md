Zoltr is an R package that contains functions for working with the Zoltar forecast repositoryâ€™s API, including projects, models, forecasts, and truth. Documentation for the package is at the [zoltr pkgdown site](http://reichlab.io/zoltr/). It is available as a [CRAN package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/zoltr/index.html), though we recommend you download the development version because we are regularly adding features that aren't yet in CRAN:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("reichlab/zoltr")
```

The source is at [github.com/reichlab/zoltr](https://github.com/reichlab/zoltr) where the latest version can be installed.
