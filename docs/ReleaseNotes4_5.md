# Welcome to Zoltar 4.5

Zoltar version 4.5 adds support for uploading forecast data in CSV format via both the programmatic [RESTful API](Api.md) and the web UI. Uploading in this format is in addition to uploading in the existing JSON format support. Details are below:

> Note: Support for operations involving forecast data in CSV format vs. JSON format is still inconsistent after this update: [Uploading a forecast](Forecasts.md#upload-a-forecast) can now be done using either format, but [Downloading multiple forecasts](Forecasts.md#download-multiple-forecasts) is in CSV format whereas [downloading a single forecast](Forecasts.md#download-a-single-forecast) is in JSON format.

- [Forecast data format (CSV)](FileFormats.md#forecast-data-format-csv): Describes the CSV file format for forecast data.
- [Upload a forecast](Forecasts.md#upload-a-forecast): Explains how to upload a forecast in either JSON or CSV format using the web UI.
- [Download forecasts via the web UI](Forecasts.md#download-forecasts-via-the-web-ui): Shows how to download forecast data in [Forecast data format (CSV)](#forecast-data-format-csv) using the web UI.
