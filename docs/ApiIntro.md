# Programming libraries and API

You can do many of the operations available in the [zoltardata.com](https://www.zoltardata.com/) web interface via the Zoltar [RESTful API](Api.md). While accessing the API directly is possible (say via [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/), [HTTPie](https://httpie.org/), etc), we have written two language bindings to simplify use from [Python](Zoltpy.md) and [R](Zoltr.md). Follow those links to learn more.
