# API

Zoltar's functionality is accessible via the following [RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) endpoints. All results are JSON. The API is browsable from the [root URI](https://www.zoltardata.com/api/) on the home page (look for `API` buttons on any page), and is a great starting point for developers. Note that all projects and users are listed on the home page, but private projects, their models, and their forecasts, can only be accessed by authorized accounts.
