Introduction \u00b6 Zoltar is a web application to that hosts a repository of model forecast results. For many existing forecasting projects, predictions made by models have been stored in differing formats and locations or in sets of unstructured data files. This complicates tracking, comparing, visualizing and scoring forecasts. Zoltar supports storing, retrieving, comparing, and analyzing time series forecasts for prediction challenges of interest to many different modeling communities. Getting started \u00b6 Use the navigation links in the sidebar to get started touring the web site , reading the user guide , or learning about our python and R packages for interacting with the Zoltar API from your programming language. Assumptions/Limitations \u00b6 The scope of this first iteration is limited in these ways: Process-agnostic : By storing only core datasets, we make no assumptions about ML processes behind a model\u2019s forecast, such as how it\u2019s fit. Enforceability : There is currently not a method in place to test whether the models were fit on the right data subsets (this is something that pipeline-focused software such as mlr3 , among others, could assist with). Unrevised vs. revised data : A Project\u2019s core dataset may or may not include data revisions, such as those used to model or forecast reporting delays. Each project should give specific instructions on what type of data (revised vs. unrevised) is used in the training and testing phases of the forecasting. Model instances : The system stores only model metadata, rather than computable representations of models (internals) that could be used to reconstruct and re-run them. Reports : Some projects generate automated narrative reports from forecast data. This system does not support storing reports with their models. Training/testing data : The only information about what subsets of the core data were used for different ML stages (e.g. training vs testing) will be stored in narrative format in the project description. Reproducibility : Since this system stores data involved in forecasts and not source code, information about how to re-run models is only captured in narrative form in the model's description, and is linked to by the model's url field.

Each forecast is made for a particular time zero in the project, and contains some number of predictions , one or more for each combination of the project's units and targets . Zoltar supports the following five prediction types, which we've found covers many forecasting applications. All predictions must pass a number of validity checks as documented in Validation . Each section has an example as represented in Zoltar's JSON format which was taken from the \"Docs Example Project\" demo project. Overview \u00b6 (Please refer to the diagram below.) A forecast is made up of metadata (the model that made the forecast, the time zero for the forecast, and the forecast's date of submission) plus the forecast's data as a set of predictions . Each prediction is a collection of one or more prediction elements specific to one target and unit. Each prediction element is of a particular type (point, named, bin, sample, and quantile, as described below). Point predictions \u00b6 Point predictions represent a single value. See here for details. In this example we see a prediction of 2.1 for the unit \"loc1\" and target \"pct next week\". Note that, like all predictions, the data type (in this case the float 2.1 ) must match the target's data type. (In this case it does; \"pct next week\" is a discrete target.) {\"unit\": \"loc1\", \"target\": \"pct next week\", \"class\": \"point\", \"prediction\": { \"value\": 2.1 } } Named distributions \u00b6 Named distributions represent distributions like normal , log normal , gamma , etc. See here for details. Here is an example in which a normal distribution (\"norm\" is the abbreviation) is specified for unit \"loc1\" and target \"pct next week\". Named predictions support up to three parameters (named \"param1\", \"param2\", and \"param3\") depending on the family. Here the normal distribution requires two parameters: mean (\"param1\") and sd (\"param2\"). \"param3\" is unused and not listed. {\"unit\": \"loc1\", \"target\": \"pct next week\", \"class\": \"named\", \"prediction\": { \"family\": \"norm\", \"param1\": 1.1, \"param2\": 2.2 } } Bin distributions \u00b6 Bin distributions represent binned distribution defined by inclusive lower bounds for each bin. See here for details. Example: {\"unit\": \"loc2\", \"target\": \"pct next week\", \"class\": \"bin\", \"prediction\": { \"cat\": [1.1, 2.2, 3.3], \"prob\": [0.3, 0.2, 0.5] } } Sample distributions \u00b6 Sample distributions represent samples taken for the unit and target. Here's an example: {\"unit\": \"loc3\", \"target\": \"pct next week\", \"class\": \"sample\", \"prediction\": { \"sample\": [2.3, 6.5, 0.0, 10.0234, 0.0001] } } Quantile distributions \u00b6 Quantile distributions represent quantiles of the predictive distribution. For example: {\"unit\": \"loc2\", \"target\": \"pct next week\", \"class\": \"quantile\", \"prediction\": { \"quantile\": [0.025, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.975], \"value\": [1.0, 2.2, 2.2, 5.0, 50.0] } }","title":"Data model"},{"location":"DataModel/#zoltar-data-model","text":"This page documents how Zoltar represents forecast data, and the various types of predictions that are supported.

Project creation configuration (JSON) Truth data format (CSV) Forecast data format (JSON) Forecast data format (CSV) Project creation configuration (JSON) \u00b6 As documented in Projects , as an alternative to manually creating a project via the web interface, projects can be created from a JSON configuration file. Here's the configuration file from the \"Docs Example Project\" demo project: zoltar-project-config.json . Project configuration files contain six metadata keys ( \"name , \"is_public\" , \"description\" , \"home_url\" , \"logo_url\" , \"core_data\" ), plus three keys that are lists of objects ( \"units\" , \"targets\" , and \"timezeros\" ). Here are the three list objects' formats: \"units\" : a list of objects containing two fields: name : The name of the unit. abbreviation : The unit's abbreviation. \"targets\" : a list of the project's targets. Please see the Targets.md file for a detailed description of target parameters and which are required. Here are all possible parameters that can be passed in a project configuration file: name : string description : string type : string - must be one of the following: continuous , discrete , nominal , binary , or date outcome_variable : string is_step_ahead : boolean numeric_horizon : integer - negative, zero, or positive reference_date_type : one of the names listed in valid reference date types range : an array (list) of two numbers cats : an array (list) of one or more numbers or strings (which depends on the target's type's data type) dates : an array (list) of one or more strings in the YYYY-MM-DD format \"timezeros\" : a list of the projects time zeros. Each has these fields: timezero_date : The timezero's date in YYYY-MM-DD format data_version_date : Optional data version date in the same format. Pass null if the timezero does not have one is_season_start : true if this starts a season, and false otherwise season_name : Applicable when is_season_start is true , names the season, e.g., \"2010-2011\" Truth data format (CSV) \u00b6 Every project in Zoltar can have ground truth values associated with targets. Users can access them as CSV as described in Truth . An example truths file is zoltar-ground-truth-example.csv . The file has four columns: timezero , unit , target , value : timezero : date the truth applies to, formatted as yyyy-mm-dd unit : the unit's abbreviation target : target name value : truth value, formatted according to the target's type. date values are formatted yyyy-mm-dd and booleans as true or false Forecast data format (JSON) \u00b6 For prediction input and output we use a JSON file format. This format is strongly inspired by https://github.com/cdcepi/predx/blob/master/predx_classes.md . See zoltar-predictions-examples.json for an example. The file contains a top-level object with two keys: \"meta\" and \"predictions\" . The meta section is unused for uploads, and for downloads contains various information about the forecast in the repository in the \"forecast\" field, plus lists of the project's \"units\" and \"targets\" . The \"predictions\" list contains objects for each prediction, and each object contains the following four keys: \"unit\" : abbreviation of the Unit. \"target\" : name of the Target. \"class\" : the type of prediction this is. It is an abbreviation of the corresponding Prediction subclass - the names are : bin , named , point , and sample . \"prediction\" : a class-specific object containing the prediction data itself. The format varies according to class. Here is a summary (see Data model for details and examples): \"bin\" : Binned distribution with a category for each bin. It is a two-column table represented by two keys, one per column: cat and prob . They are paired, i.e., have the same number of rows. \"named\" : A named distribution with four fields: family and param1 through param3 . family names must be one of : norm , lnorm , gamma , beta , bern , binom , pois , nbinom , and nbinom2 . \"point : A numeric point prediction with a single value key. \"sample\" : Numeric samples represented as a table with one column that is found in the sample key. \"quantile\" : A quantile distribution with two paired columns: quantile and value . To indicate a Retracted prediction in JSON files, by use null for the \"prediction\" value. For example: { \"unit\": \"loc1\", \"target\": \"pct next week\", \"class\": \"point\", \"prediction\": null } Forecast data format (CSV) \u00b6 Zoltar supports uploading and downloading forecast data in a CSV format with the following columns. It helps to think of this format as an \"exploded\" version of the prediction elements in the JSON format, where each element expands into one or more rows. named and point types expand into single rows, and bin , sample , and quantile types expand into one or more rows depending on the particular data. You can read more about prediction types on tje data model page . Note that because different prediction types have different contents, the CSV rows are \"sparse\" in that not every row uses all columns (the unused ones are empty, i.e., \"\" ). However, the unit , target , and class columns are always non-empty. For example, a point row only uses the value column whereas a quantile row uses only the value and quantile columns. To learn more you can examine the example file zoltar-predictions-examples.csv , which contains the same data as zoltar-predictions-examples.json , but in CSV format. Here are the columns used in the format, in order. Note that there are three additional columns present when downloading forecast data: model , timezero , and season . They are positioned before the unit column. These three columns are not present when uploading forecast data. unit : the prediction's unit target : \"\" target class : \"\" prediction type. one of bin , named , point , sample , and quantile value : used for point and quantile prediction types. empty otherwise cat : used for bin prediction types. empty otherwise prob : \"\" sample : used for sample prediction types. empty otherwise quantile : used for quantile prediction types. empty otherwise family : family name for named predictions. see Named Prediction Elements for a list of them param1 : parameter \"\" param2 : parameter \"\" param3 : parameter \"\" To indicate a Retracted prediction in CSV files, put NULL (no quote marks) in the non-sparce cells. Taking the above example, a retracted point row would have NULL for its value , and a retracted quantile row would have NULL for both value and quantile . Note that only one NULL row of multi-row prediction types ( bin , sample , and quantile ) needs to be present to retract a prediction element. For example, here are three retracted rows: unit,target,class,value,cat,prob,sample,quantile,family,param1,param2,param3 loc2,pct next week,point,\"NULL\",,,,,,,, loc2,pct next week,bin,,\"NULL\",\"NULL\",,,,,, loc2,pct next week,quantile,\"NULL\",,,,\"NULL\",,,,","title":"File Formats"},{"location":"FileFormats/#file-formats","text":"Zoltar uses a number of formats for representing truth data, forecast data, configurations, etc. This page documents those.

They are paired, i.e., have the same number of rows. \"named\" : A named distribution with four fields: family and param1 through param3 . family names must be one of : norm , lnorm , gamma , beta , bern , binom , pois , nbinom , and nbinom2 . \"point : A numeric point prediction with a single value key. \"sample\" : Numeric samples represented as a table with one column that is found in the sample key. \"quantile\" : A quantile distribution with two paired columns: quantile and value . To indicate a Retracted prediction in JSON files, by use null for the \"prediction\" value. For example: { \"unit\": \"loc1\", \"target\": \"pct next week\", \"class\": \"point\", \"prediction\": null }","title":"Forecast data format (JSON)"},{"location":"FileFormats/#forecast-data-format-csv","text":"Zoltar supports uploading and downloading forecast data in a CSV format with the following columns. It helps to think of this format as an \"exploded\" version of the prediction elements in the JSON format, where each element expands into one or more rows. named and point types expand into single rows, and bin , sample , and quantile types expand into one or more rows depending on the particular data. You can read more about prediction types on tje data model page . Note that because different prediction types have different contents, the CSV rows are \"sparse\" in that not every row uses all columns (the unused ones are empty, i.e., \"\" ). However, the unit , target , and class columns are always non-empty. For example, a point row only uses the value column whereas a quantile row uses only the value and quantile columns. To learn more you can examine the example file zoltar-predictions-examples.csv , which contains the same data as zoltar-predictions-examples.json , but in CSV format. Here are the columns used in the format, in order. Note that there are three additional columns present when downloading forecast data: model , timezero , and season . They are positioned before the unit column. These three columns are not present when uploading forecast data. unit : the prediction's unit target : \"\" target class : \"\" prediction type. one of bin , named , point , sample , and quantile value : used for point and quantile prediction types. empty otherwise cat : used for bin prediction types. empty otherwise prob : \"\" sample : used for sample prediction types. empty otherwise quantile : used for quantile prediction types. empty otherwise family : family name for named predictions. see Named Prediction Elements for a list of them param1 : parameter \"\" param2 : parameter \"\" param3 : parameter \"\" To indicate a Retracted prediction in CSV files, put NULL (no quote marks) in the non-sparce cells. Taking the above example, a retracted point row would have NULL for its value , and a retracted quantile row would have NULL for both value and quantile . Note that only one NULL row of multi-row prediction types ( bin , sample , and quantile ) needs to be present to retract a prediction element. For example, here are three retracted rows: unit,target,class,value,cat,prob,sample,quantile,family,param1,param2,param3 loc2,pct next week,point,\"NULL\",,,,,,,, loc2,pct next week,bin,,\"NULL\",\"NULL\",,,,,, loc2,pct next week,quantile,\"NULL\",,,,\"NULL\",,,,","title":"Forecast data format (CSV)"},{"location":"ForecastDetailPage/","text":"Forecast detail page \u00b6 The forecast detail page shows information about a particular forecast, and is divided into five vertical sections with bold headings, described next: Details table , Units present , Targets present , Predictions present , and Query form and results .

You can download from the web UI as described in Download forecasts via the web UI or through the API. Querying workflow \u00b6 Like uploading a forecast , querying a project's forecasts can be a long operation. For this reason, Zoltar enqueues queries as jobs that are operated on separately from the web process. This means querying follows these steps: Create and submit the query . This returns a job that you can use to a) track the status of the query, and b) download the query results (forecast data). Poll the job until its status is SUCCESS . (You can use the web UI to do this as well. See Check an upload's status for how.) Download the data associated with the job. Query format \u00b6 Zoltar supports a simple filtering feature that allows users to limit what data is downloaded. To filter a project's forecast data, we support the following six types of filters. They are passed behind the scenes to the server as a JSON object with keys and values. Logically, the filters are treated as a list of \"ANDs of ORs\": Each of the five filter types are lists that are considered individually as ORs. For example, a list of models means get data from any of them. The filters are combined by ANDs, meaning only data that matches all filters. (See the below example.) The types of filters are: 1) Filter by model : Pass zero or more model abbreviations in the models field. Example: {\"models\": [\"60-contact\", \"CovidIL_100\"]} # gets data only from either of these two models 2) Filter by unit : Pass zero or more unit abbreviations in the units field. Example: {\"units\": [\"US\"]} # get data only for this unit 3) Filter by target : Pass zero or more target names in the targets field. Example: {\"targets\": [\"0 day ahead cum death\", \"1 day ahead cum death\"]} # get data only for either of these two targets 4) Filter by timezero : Pass zero or more timezero dates in yyyy-mm-dd format in the timezeros field. Example: {\"timezeros\": [\"2020-05-14\", \"2020-05-09\"]} # get data only for either of these two time zeros 5) Filter by forecast type : Pass a list of string types in the types field. Choices are bin , named , point , sample , and quantile . Example: {\"types\": [\"point\", \"quantile\"]} # get only point and quantile data 6) Filter by forecast version : Passing a datetime string in the optional as_of field causes the query to return only those forecast versions whose issued_at is <= the as_of datetime (AKA timestamp). If no as_of is passed then the query returns the most recent forecasts. (See Forecast Versions for more about versions.) The as_of field format must be a datetime as parsed by the dateutil python library , which accepts a variety of styles. You can find example here . Importantly, the datetime must include timezone information for disambiguation, without which the query will fail. (Note that Zoltar displays all datetimes using the UTC timezone.) Here's an example: {\"as_of\": \"2021-05-10 12:00 UTC \"} # get forecasts whose issued_at is <= this date The lists in 1 through 5 operate as \"OR\" on their own but are combined in the final query as \"AND\"s. Here's an example: {\"models\": [\"60-contact\", \"CovidIL_100\"], \"units\": [\"US\"], \"targets\": [\"0 day ahead cum death\", \"1 day ahead cum death\"], \"timezeros\": [\"2020-05-14\", \"2020-05-09\"], \"types\": [\"point\", \"quantile\"] } This results in data that is: (from either the 60-contact OR CovidIL_100 models) AND (the unit is US ) AND (the target is either 0 day ahead cum death or 1 day ahead cum death ) AND (the timezero is either 2020-05-14 OR 2020-05-09 ) AND (the prediction type is either point OR quantile ) Note that not all types of filters are required to be specified. Any missing ones are treated by default as \"all\". In the previous example, if we omitted types then we'd get similar data except it would include all prediction types instead of just point or quantile ones. Query options \u00b6 Some features (currently only automatic prediction type conversion) require additional information to run. This is specified via the options field, which is an object that acts like a flat dot-namespaced registry ala Firefox's Configuration Editor (its about:config page). Keys are period-delimited strings and values are option-specific values. Here's the above query with some options: {\"models\": [\"60-contact\", \"CovidIL_100\"], \"units\": [\"US\"], \"targets\": [\"0 day ahead cum death\", \"1 day ahead cum death\"], \"timezeros\": [\"2020-05-14\", \"2020-05-09\"], \"types\": [\"point\", \"quantile\"], \"options\": {\"convert.bin\": true, \"convert.point\": \"mean\", \"convert.quantile\": [0.025, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.975], \"convert.sample\": 100} } Automatic prediction type conversion \u00b6 Zoltar supports converting automatically from some prediction types to desired ones that have not actually been uploaded. Note: Conversion is currently limited, with support coming for additional prediction types and target types. Also note that the auto-conversion feature results in slower queries than when it is not requested. Auto-conversion is activated via two query parameters: Specify the forecast types (#5 above) that you want the program to convert TO (the default, if unspecified is all types). Include query options for the conversions you want. Including an option does two things: a) it tells Zoltar that it should convert TO that type (i.e., that conversion is activated), and b) possible details about how to do the conversion. Here are all the conversions that we hope to support (TO on the arrow left and FROM on the right): `bin` <- `named`, `sample` # can convert named or samples to bin. options: none `named` <- n/a # no conversion to named is possible `point` <- `named`, `sample` # can convert named or samples to point. options: 'mean' or 'median' `quantile` <- `named`, `sample` # \"\" samples. options: list of quantiles `sample` <- `named` # can convert named to samples. options: number of samples Here are the corresponding query options (see the example query above): convert.bin : a boolean indicating conversion to bin is desired convert.point : a string indicating conversion to points is desired: either 'mean' or 'median' convert.quantile : a list indicating conversion to quantiles is desired: a list of unique numbers in [0, 1] convert.sample : an integer indicating conversion to samples is desired: an int >0 Converting takes into account each prediction element's target's type : continuous : OK (mean, median) discrete : OK (mean, median) nominal : TBD (mode: which value, TRUE or FALSE, is more present in the samples) binary : TBD (mode: which value, TRUE or FALSE, is more present in the samples date : TBD (don\u2019t support for now) Currently, only these combinations are implemented: target types: continuous, discrete conversions: point <- sample (uses either statistics.mean() or statistics.median() depending on the convert.point option) conversions: quantile <- sample (uses numpy.quantile() ) Data format \u00b6 The forecasts are returned in the CSV format documented at Forecast data format (CSV) .

A version is identified by the combination of the forecast's model , time zero , and issued_at fields. Multiple versions for the same model and time zero will have different issued_at values. These can be identified by the gray version numbering shown in the version column on the model detail page 's Forecasts list (e.g., \"1 of 2\"), and on the Issued at row of the forecast detail page 's information table at the top (e.g., \"(Version 3 of 3)\"). Forecast version rules \u00b6 Zoltar enforces these rules about forecast versions: No uploaded forecast can have no rows of data. No uploaded forecast can load 100% duplicate data of a previous version. New forecast versions cannot imply any retracted prediction elements in existing versions, i.e., you cannot load data that's a subset of the previous forecast's data. New forecast versions cannot be positioned before any existing versions. Editing a version's issued_at cannot reposition it before any existing forecasts. Deleted forecasts cannot be positioned before any newer versions. Notes: - Rule 3 applies only to non-oracle forecasts, i.e., truth forecasts are allowed to be partial because we assume truth retractions are not allowed. - This means we require forecasts to be uploaded in issued_at order. If you need to \"backfill\" older versions, you'll first have to delete forecasts with newer issued_at datetimes before uploading older ones. Retracted predictions \u00b6 Zoltar supports retracting individual prediction elements. A retracted element marks a particular combination of unit, target, and prediction type to be ignored when executing a forecast query if the user passes an as_of value that's on or later than the retraction issued_at . In that case there will be no value returned for the retracted prediction element. However, an as_of that's earlier than the forecast's issued_at will result in the element's pre-retraction value being returned.

See Data Model for detail on the structure of predictions. Following are the forecast operations you can do from within Zoltar. Note: Operations on forecasts, like many Zoltar activities, can be done either through the zoltardata.com web interface or programmatically using the Zoltar libraries . Note: As mentioned in Concepts , forecasts can have versions via their issued_at field. However, versioning is currently supported only via the API. Upload a forecast \u00b6 Here we show how to upload forecast data into Zoltar. Note: As mentioned at Jobs , uploading a forecast is done in a separate worker process because it may take more than a handful of seconds to run. Thus, the workflow is based on that (see Job workflow for details). Forecasts are uploaded to a particular model for a particular time zero. To upload one: Go to the model detail page of the one you want to upload into. Make sure \"Hide if no data\" is unchecked. Find the time zero that the forecast is associated with. If the time zero already has a forecast then delete it (see Delete a forecast below). You can tell if a time zero has an uploaded forecast in two ways: the text in the \"Data Source\" column is a link instead of the words \"(No data)\" and the icon in the \"Action\" column is a red trash can and not a green upload icon. Click the \"Browse...\" button in the time zero's \"Action\" column. In the dialog that appears, select a Zoltar Forecast data file. The format can be either JSON or CSV . Click the green upload button. If the file is OK then you will be taken to a job detail page that shows the status of your upload, with the message \"Queued the forecast file _ for uploading.\", where _ is your file's name. Once the upload is successful (you can refresh the job detail page to check) then you will see the newly-uploaded file listed next to the selected time zero on the model detail page . If there was a problem uploading then you will see the upload's status as FAILED . The Failure section will provide some information to help debug the problem. Delete a forecast \u00b6 Delete a forecast via these steps: Go to the model detail page where the forecast resides. Click the red trash can button in the \"Action\" column. Click \"Delete\" in the confirmation dialog that appears. Note that this cannot be undone! Download a single forecast \u00b6 To download a particular forecast: Go to the model detail page where the forecast resides. Click the link in the \"Data Source\" column to go to the forecast detail page . Click the \"Download JSON\" button and save the file in the JSON format documented at Forecast data format for details.

Download multiple forecasts \u00b6 Note: Downloading multiple forecasts is currently available only to users with Zoltar accounts. Note: As mentioned at Jobs , downloading a forecast is done in a separate worker process because it may take more than a handful of seconds to run. Thus, the workflow is based on that (see Job workflow for details). Forecasts are downloaded by executing a forecast query by either a) Zoltar API using the Zoltar libraries , or b) via a simple web UI form (shown below). In both cases you need to follow these steps: Decide the data of interest (i.e., models , units , targets , timezeros , and prediction types ). Submit the query to get a Job ID. Poll the resulting Job until it succeeds (see Check a job's status ). Download the job's data (see Download a job's data ). The format is described at Forecast data format (CSV) . Download forecasts via the web UI \u00b6 To download forecast data via the web UI: Go to the project detail page whose models contain the forecasts. Click the \"Download\" button to the right of \"Forecasts\" in the Features section at the page's top. On the \"Edit Forecast Query\" page that shows, enter your query and then click \"Submit\" (see the screenshot below). Poll the resulting Job until it succeeds (see Check a job's status ). Download the job's data (see Download a job's data ). Here's an example of the Edit Forecast Query page: Download the Zoltar database for local use [BETA] \u00b6 Zoltar along with Zoltpy supports downloading the Zoltar database itself as an sqlite3 database file for local querying. (We call this a \"bulk\" download.) This beta feature was developed for programs that need to perform too many forecast queries to go through the server. Note: This feature is an admin-level one that does not have a convenient web service interface. Please contact us if you'd like to use this feature. There are three overall steps to use the feature and each step has a corresponding command line program. Following are the details. 1) [server] Dump/export a selected portion of the Zoltar database to zipped CSV files. Run the program utils/bulk_data_dump.py to create a zipped archive of CSV files that can be loaded into an sqlite3 database file (step 2). This program takes three args: project_name : the name of an existing Project to dump data from query_file : a JSON file that specifies the initial filtering to do when dumping the database. This is an object that filters the dump. it is the same as the query arg to query_forecasts_for_project() except that 'types' and 'as_of' are disallowed. i.e., what's allowed is: 'models', 'units', 'targets', and 'timezeros'. output_dir : where to save the zip file that contains the dumped CSV files Once you've run this program you can share the outputted zip file with bulk data users, who will run steps 2 and 3 on their local machines. Note: The dump program limits the number of PredictionElement table rows to MAX_NUM_PRED_ELES (currently two million). You may need to increase this depending on the initial filtering query. 2) [zoltpy] Load those files into a local sqlite3 database file. The program cli/bulk_data_load.py loads the CSV files created in step #1 into a new sqlite database file. It takes these args: zip_file : the zip file as created by the dump program sqlite_file : sqlite file to save to. must not exist 3) [zoltpy] Run forecast queries against that file. Finally, you can query the sqlite3 file using the cli/bulk_data_query.py command: sqlite_file : the sqlite database file as created by bulk_data_load_app() query_file : a JSON file that contains the query, as documented at forecast query format csv_file : where to save the CSV file to.

Note: As mentioned at Jobs , uploading a forecast is done in a separate worker process because it may take more than a handful of seconds to run. Thus, the workflow is based on that (see Job workflow for details). Forecasts are uploaded to a particular model for a particular time zero. To upload one: Go to the model detail page of the one you want to upload into. Make sure \"Hide if no data\" is unchecked. Find the time zero that the forecast is associated with. If the time zero already has a forecast then delete it (see Delete a forecast below). You can tell if a time zero has an uploaded forecast in two ways: the text in the \"Data Source\" column is a link instead of the words \"(No data)\" and the icon in the \"Action\" column is a red trash can and not a green upload icon. Click the \"Browse...\" button in the time zero's \"Action\" column. In the dialog that appears, select a Zoltar Forecast data file. The format can be either JSON or CSV . Click the green upload button. If the file is OK then you will be taken to a job detail page that shows the status of your upload, with the message \"Queued the forecast file _ for uploading.\", where _ is your file's name. Once the upload is successful (you can refresh the job detail page to check) then you will see the newly-uploaded file listed next to the selected time zero on the model detail page .

Issued at : The datetime identifying the forecast's version . If there is more than one version for this forecast's timezero then text like \"Version 1 of 2\" will show in the Version column. (See Forecast Versions for more about versions.) Version : Text describing the version, such as \"Version 1 of 2\". It is empty if there's only one forecast version for the timezero. Action : A button that is either a green upload icon if there is no data associated with the time zero, or a red delete button otherwise. See Forecasts for instructions on how to upload forecasts, and File formats for how forecast files are structured in Zoltar. This feature is enabled only for project owners or model owners. The Hide if no data checkbox, if checked, shows only those Timezeros that have an uploaded forecast.

Every forecast has a time zero. See Concepts for more about time zeros. Data version date : An optional piece of metadata for a forecast. If it exists, it is associated with a time zero. It refers to the latest date at which any data source used for the forecasts should be considered. If present, it can be used externally by system users to recreate model results by \"rolling back\" the core data to a particular state. # Forecasts : A count of the number of forecasts for this time zero.

(Fill out the Zoltardata.com user request form to be added to our beta-tester invitation queue.) Create a project \u00b6 There are two ways to create a project: by editing a form or by uploading a JSON project configuration file. Using a form is a quick way to make a project to get a team started, but is very limited in what can be specified, mainly the information in the Details table as described in the link above (name, visibility, description, home URL, core data, logo url, and model owners). The second method - using a configuration file - is preferred as it allows specifying all aspects of a project. Both methods are accessed via the green \"New\" dropdown button at the top of the Projects page . To create a project via a form: \u00b6 Click the green \"New\" button at the top of the projects list and select \"From form...\" Fill in the fields and click \"Create\". Most fields are required, which will be indicated with error messages when you submit the form and any are missing. To create a project via a configuration file: \u00b6 Click the green \"New\" dropdown button at the top of the projects list and select \"From file...\" In the dialog that appears, click the \"Browse...\" button to select a project configuration JSON file. Click the green upload button. Depending on the file you uploaded you will see either a message noting success (\"Created project __\" message at the top of the page) or an error page with a message showing the details. It may be helpful to get started by downloading and modifying an existing project's configuration file: Go to the project of interest's detail page . At the top, to the right of the project name, click the green download \"Config\" button and save the file. Note that the id and url fields in the downloaded file are ignored when creating a new project from that file, and can safely be edited out when creating your new file. Edit a project \u00b6 There are two ways to edit a project, similar to creating one as described above: by editing a form or by uploading an edited version of the original JSON project configuration file that was used to create the project. Both are accessed from the project's detail page using the green \"Edit\" dropdown button to the right of the project name. To edit a project via a form: \u00b6 Click the green \"Edit\" dropdown button at the top of the projects list and select \"From form...\" Edit the fields as above and then click \"Save\". To edit a project via a configuration file: \u00b6 Click the green \"Edit\" dropdown button at the top of the projects list and select \"From file...\" In the dialog that appears, click the \"Browse...\" button to select a project configuration JSON file. Click the green edit button. This invokes a kind of \"diff\" analysis that compares the uploaded file to the to-be-edited project's current structure. The result is shown on a \"Confirm project configuration changes\" page listing the changes you're about to apply. (You will see an error page if there's a problem with the uploaded file.) The confirmation page has three possible sections: A sentence at the top summarizing the changes, including whether any will delete data. All changes : All changes that were detected, including both non-data-destructive and destructive ones. Changes that will delete data : Lists just the data-destructive changes, including details about what kinds of predictions (or truth) will be deleted, and how many of each. Here's an example: The diff function categorizes each change according to the type of change and what item it applies to. For example, the first change under All changes in the above screenshot is the editing of the project's \"name\" field. Another change is the third one in that list, which is the removal of the unit abbreviated \"loc3\". Here are all the kinds of change that might be identified: OBJ_ADDED : An item of a particular type will be added to the project. For example, adding a new unit abbreviated \"loc4\". OBJ_REMOVED : \"\" will be removed \"\" from a project. Removing the target \"pct next week\", say. FIELD_EDITED : An item's field will be set to a new value. For example, setting the \"data_version_date\" of the project's time zero named \"2011-10-09\". FIELD_ADDED : Set an item's field that was not set before. Adding a \"season_name\" to the time zero \"2011-10-16\", say. FIELD_REMOVED : Remove an item's field, such as the \"numeric_horizon\" of the target \"cases next week\".\" As implied above, there are four types of item that can be changed: The project itself or one of its units , targets , or time zeros .

Read on for details. Forecast versioning \u00b6 Recall that the version of Zoltar prior to this new one added support for storing forecast versions. From the new Forecast Versions page: Forecasts in Zoltar can be versioned . A version is identified by the combination of the forecast's model , time zero , and issue date . Multiple versions for the same model and time zero will have different issue dates. These can be identified by the gray version numbering shown in the version column on the model detail page 's Forecasts list (e.g., \"1 of 2\"), and on the Issue date row of the forecast detail page 's information table at the top (e.g., \"(Version 3 of 3)\"). Data migration \u00b6 This upgrade required migrating existing data, which we've done, but which resulted in a few forecasts that needed modifying. We've notified individual modelers of any problematic ones. Forecast version rules \u00b6 We now enforce these version rules : No uploaded forecast can have no rows of data. No uploaded forecast can load 100% duplicate data of a previous version. New forecast versions cannot imply any retracted prediction elements in existing versions, i.e., you cannot load data that's a subset of the previous forecast's data. New forecast versions cannot be positioned before any existing versions. Editing a version's issue_date cannot reposition it before any existing forecasts. Deleted forecasts cannot be positioned before any newer versions. Bullet three means we require forecasts to be uploaded in issue_date order. If you need to back-fill older versions, you'll first have to delete forecasts with newer issue_dates before uploading older ones. Skipping of duplicate forecast data \u00b6 Zoltar now implements a space optimization where duplicate data between forecast versions is not saved on disk. The forecast query feature hides this from users by reassembling the data as needed. Forecast retractions \u00b6 Zoltar now supports the notion of \"retracting\" forecasts. Such retractions mark individual prediction elements so that the as_of forecast query parameter hides those predictions. The retracted data is not deleted, and earlier as_of values will still return that data when passing an as_of value that is prior to the retraction. From the Retracted predictions page: Zoltar supports retracting individual prediction elements. A retracted element marks a particular combination of unit, target, and prediction type to be ignored when executing a forecast query if the user passes an as_of value that's on or later than the retraction issue_date . In that case there will be no value returned for the retracted prediction element. However, an as_of that's earlier than the forecast's issue_date will result in the element's pre-retraction value being returned. Users who want to return the forecast's original data including retractions, should use the API or web UI as documented in download a single forecast . In this case Zoltar will include retractions as they were uploaded - with null \"prediction\" value in the JSON (see below). For users of the quantile forecast CSV format: Retractions are indicated in quantile CSV files by NULL point and quantile values. The libraries take care of converting these into the JSON below. See Quantile forecast format (CSV) for quantile retraction format details.","title":"Zoltar 4 Release Notes"},{"location":"ReleaseNotes4_0/#welcome-to-zoltar-4","text":"Zoltar version 4 is a major upgrade to Zoltar's fundamental forecast data representation, enabling new forecast versioning features.

However, an as_of that's earlier than the forecast's issue_date will result in the element's pre-retraction value being returned. Users who want to return the forecast's original data including retractions, should use the API or web UI as documented in download a single forecast . In this case Zoltar will include retractions as they were uploaded - with null \"prediction\" value in the JSON (see below). For users of the quantile forecast CSV format: Retractions are indicated in quantile CSV files by NULL point and quantile values. The libraries take care of converting these into the JSON below.

In Zoltar, a single forecast made by a model may give predictions for multiple targets. For example, a single forecast might include a forecast of 1- and 2-week-ahead values and a prediction of when the time series will reach its maximum in a given period of time. When a project is created, the project owner specifies which targets should be part of any submitted forecast. As we will see below, targets have specific properties, and there are several types of targets that determine which properties and features pertain to a particular target. Target types \u00b6 continuous : A quantitative target whose range encapsulates a section of the real number line. Examples: percentage of all doctors' office visits due to influenza like-illness, or disease incidence per 100,000 population. discrete : A quantitative target whose range is a set of integer values. Example: the number of incident cases in a time period. nominal : A nominal, unordered categorical target. Example: severity level in categories of \"low\", \"moderate\", and \"high\". binary : A binary target, with a defined outcome that can be seen as a true/false. Example: does the maximum value of a variable exceed some threshold C in a given period of time. date : A target with a discrete set of calendar dates as possible outcomes. Example: the calendar week in which peak incidence occurs (represented by the Sunday of that week. Target parameters \u00b6 When created, all targets have a set of parameters that must be defined. Each type of target then has a set of additional, sometimes, optional parameters. These are all defined below. Summary of allowed, optional, and required parameters, by target type \u00b6 Here is a table that summarizes which are allowed, optional, and required, by type. legend: 'x' = required, '(x)' = required if is_step_ahead is true , '-' = disallowed, '~' = optional. target type type name description outcome_variable is_step_ahead numeric_horizon RDT range cats continuous x x x x x (x) (x) ~ ~ discrete x x x x x (x) (x) ~ ~ nominal x x x x x (x) (x) - x binary x x x x x (x) (x) - - date x x x x x (x) (x) - x Required parameters for all targets \u00b6 name : A brief name for the target.

It is required if is_step_ahead is true . reference date type (RDT): An integer that indicates how this target calculates reference_date and target_end_date from a timezero. It is required if is_step_ahead is true . The allowed values are hard-coded (see the valid reference date types table below) and will be used for an upcoming visualization feature (more documentation to come then). valid reference date types \u00b6 Following are the allowed reference date types. id is the integer value that's actually stored in the database, name is the \"official\" unique name used by project configuration files , and abbreviation is used to calculate target group names. id name abbreviation 0 DAY day 1 MMWR_WEEK_LAST_TIMEZERO_MONDAY week 2 MMWR_WEEK_LAST_TIMEZERO_TUESDAY week 3 BIWEEK biweek Parameters specific to continuous targets \u00b6 range : (Optional) a numeric vector of length 2 specifying a lower and upper bound of a range for the continuous target. The range is assumed to be inclusive on the lower bound and open on the upper bound, e.g. [a, b). If range is not specified than range is assumed to be (-infty, infty). cats : (Optional, but uploaded Bin prediction types will be rejected unless these are specified) an ordered set of numeric values indicating the inclusive lower-bounds for the bins of binned distributions. E.g. if cats is specified as [0, 1.1, 2.2] then the implied set of valid intervals would be [0,1.1), [1.1,2.2) and [2.2, \\infty).

Before describing details below about managing truth, we need to lay out how Zoltar stores truth and how it supports truth versioning. When a truth file is loaded (see file format information below), Zoltar groups the input rows (point predictions) by timezero and then loads all predictions for each timezero into one forecast in an internally-managed \"oracle\" model. This results in a group of forecasts that stemmed from the same truth file, and we call this group a \"batch\". The loader sets all the oracle forecasts for a particular batch to have the same source and issued_at fields, and that 2-tuple is how we identify batches. (Unlike user-created models, the oracle model is not directly worked with; it's all handled through truth-specific functionality, but you will see oracle and batch information in the user interface.) Because truth is stored as Zoltar forecasts, truth versioning is supported: each uploaded batch represents a version. Manging truth data \u00b6 Truth data is specified as a CSV file as documented in Truth data format , and each project is responsible for generating the CSV file for their particular set of time zeros , units and targets . You can tell whether truth has been uploaded to a project by looking at the Truth Data row in the Project details table section of the project detail page .

Here's a screenshot showing a project where truth has been uploaded (circled in red). You can see that two truth file versions have been loaded, resulting in two batches of oracle forecasts.

For one prediction element, the values within prob must sum to 1.0 (values within +/- 0.001 of 1 are acceptable). The data format of cat should correspond or be translatable to the type as in the target definition. Named Prediction Elements \u00b6 We note that Named predictions currently only support fairly simple distributions. We currently support distributions with up to three parameters. Future versions of Zoltar could support distributions with larger numbers of parameters. If a Named Prediction Element exists, it should have exactly 1 Database Row. family : must be one of the abbreviations shown in the table below. param1 , param2 , param3 (f): The number of param columns with non-NULL entries count must match family definition (see note below). Parameters for each distribution must be within valid ranges, which, if constraints exist, are specified in the table below. For reference, here is the mapping between the generic parameter names and the family-specific use of them (based on predx_classes.md ): Family abbreviation param1 param2 param3 Normal norm mean sd>=0 - LogNormal lnorm mean sd>=0 - Gamma gamma shape>0 rate>0 - Beta beta a>0 b>0 - Poisson pois rate>0 - - Neg.Binom1 nbinom r>0 0<=p<=1 - Neg.Binom2 nbinom2 mean>0 disp>0 - Point Prediction Elements \u00b6 If a Point Prediction Element exists, it should have exactly 1 Database Row for all targets. value (i, f, t, d, b): Entries in the database rows in the value column cannot be \u201c\u201d , \u201cNA\u201d or NULL (case does not matter). The data format of value should correspond or be translatable to the type as in the target definition. Sample Prediction Elements \u00b6 If a Sample Prediction Element exists, it should have >=1 Database Rows. sample (i, f, t, d, b): Entries in the database rows in the sample column cannot be \u201c\u201d , \u201cNA\u201d or NULL (case does not matter). The data format of sample should correspond or be translatable to the type as in the target definition. Quantile Prediction Elements \u00b6 If a Quantile Prediction Element exists, it should have >=1 Database Rows. |quantile| = |value| . The number of elements in the quantile and value vectors should be identical. quantile (f): [0, 1]. Entries in the database rows in the quantile column must be numbers in [0, 1]. quantile s must be unique. value (i, f, d): Entries in value must be non-decreasing as quantiles increase. Entries in value must obey existing ranges for targets. The data format of value should correspond or be translatable to the type as in the target definition. Tests for Predictions by Target Type \u00b6 These tests are performed when a forecast is created or updated. \"continuous\" \u00b6 Within one prediction, there can be at most one of the following prediction elements, but not both: { Named , Bin }. \"discrete\" \u00b6 Within one prediction, there can be at most one of the following prediction elements, but not both: { Named , Bin }. Tests for Prediction Elements by Target Type \u00b6 These tests are performed when a forecast is created or updated. For all target types, only valid Prediction Types are accepted. \"continuous\" \u00b6 any values in Point or Sample Prediction Elements should be numeric if range is specified, any values in Point or Sample Prediction Elements should be contained within range if range is specified, any Named Prediction Element should have negligible probability density (no more than 0.001 density) outside of the range. for Bin Prediction Elements, the submitted set of cat values must be a subset of the cats defined by the target for Named Prediction Elements, the distribution must be one of norm , lnorm , gamma , beta \"discrete\" \u00b6 any values in Point or Sample Prediction Elements should be integers if range is specified, any values in Point or Sample Prediction Elements should be contained within range if range is specified, any Named Prediction Element should have negligible probability density (no more than 0.001 density) outside of the range for Bin Prediction Elements, the submitted set of cat values must be a subset of the cats defined by the target for Named Prediction Elements, the distribution must be one of pois , nbinom , nbinom2 . \"nominal\" \u00b6 any values in Point or Sample Prediction Elements should be contained within the valid set of cats defined by the target for Bin Prediction Elements, the submitted set of cat values must be a subset of the cats defined by the target \"binary\" \u00b6 any values in Point or Sample Prediction Elements should be either true or false . for Bin Prediction Elements, there must be exactly two cat values labeled true and false . These are the two cats that are implied (but not allowed to be specified) by binary target types. \"date\" \u00b6 any values in Point or Sample Prediction Elements should be string that can be interpreted as a date in YYYY-MM-DD format, and these values should be contained within the set of valid responses defined by cats defined by the target. for Bin Prediction Elements, the submitted set of cats must be a subset of the valid outcomes defined by the target range. Tests for target definitions by Target Type \u00b6 These tests are performed when a target is created or updated. \"continuous\" \u00b6 if both range and cats are specified, then the min(cats) must equal the lower bound and max(cats) must be less than the upper bound. if range is specified it must contain two numeric values range lower bound must be smaller than the upper bound. if range is specified, is assumed to be inclusive on the lower bound and open on the upper bound, e.g. [a, b). \"discrete\" \u00b6 if range is specified, it must include two integers. \"nominal\" \u00b6 cats must be a character vector containing a set of unique labels of the categories for this target. The labels must not include \"\" , NA or NULL (case does not matter). \"binary\" \u00b6 none. \"date\" \u00b6 the unit parameter is required to be one of month , week , biweek , or day the date parameter must contain a list of text elements in YYYY-MM-DD format that can be interpreted as dates. Tests for ground truth data tables \u00b6 Please see zoltar-ground-truth-example.csv for an example of a valid specification of ground-truth values. For all ground truth files \u00b6 The columns are timezero , unit , target , and value . For every unique target - unit - timezero combination, there should be either one or zero rows of truth data. Every value of timezero , target and unit must be in the list of valid values defined by the project configuration file. (Note: not every combination needs to exist for the file to be valid.) The value of the truth data cannot be \u201c\u201d , \u201cNA\u201d or NULL (case does not matter). The value of the truth data should be interpretable as the corresponding data_type of the specified target. E.g., for a row corresponding to a date target, the entry must contain a valid ISO-formatted date string. Range-check for ground truth data \u00b6 The following test can be applied to any target with a range . This will always apply to binary , nominal , and date targets, as these targets are required to have sets of valid values specified as part of the target definition. If the range parameter is specified for a continuous or discrete target, then the following test will be applied to that target as well. For binary targets: - The entry in the value column for a specific target - unit - timezero combination must be either true or false . For discrete and continuous targets (if range is specified): - The entry in the value column for a specific target - unit - timezero combination must be contained within the range of valid values for the target. If cats is specified but range is not, then there is an implicit range for the ground truth value, and that is between min( cats ) and \\infty. For nominal and date target_types: - The entry in the value column for a specific target - unit - timezero combination must be contained within the set of valid cats for the target, as defined by the project config file.","title":"Validation"},{"location":"Validation/#forecast-validation","text":"Forecasts stored in Zoltar are validated upon upload based on the expected structure of each forecast.
