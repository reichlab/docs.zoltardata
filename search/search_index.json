Introduction \u00b6 Zoltar is a web application to that hosts a repository of model forecast results. For many existing forecasting projects, predictions made by models have been stored in differing formats and locations or in sets of unstructured data files. This complicates tracking, comparing, visualizing and scoring forecasts. Zoltar supports storing, retrieving, comparing, and analyzing time series forecasts for prediction challenges of interest to many different modeling communities. Getting started \u00b6 Use the navigation links in the sidebar to get started touring the web site , reading the user guide , or learning about our python and R packages for interacting with the Zoltar API from your programming language. Assumptions/Limitations \u00b6 The scope of this first iteration is limited in these ways: Process-agnostic : By storing only core datasets, we make no assumptions about ML processes behind a model\u2019s forecast, such as how it\u2019s fit. Enforceability : There is currently not a method in place to test whether the models were fit on the right data subsets (this is something that pipeline-focused software such as mlr3 , among others, could assist with). Unrevised vs. revised data : A Project\u2019s core dataset may or may not include data revisions, such as those used to model or forecast reporting delays. Each project should give specific instructions on what type of data (revised vs. unrevised) is used in the training and testing phases of the forecasting. Model instances : The system stores only model metadata, rather than computable representations of models (internals) that could be used to reconstruct and re-run them. Reports : Some projects generate automated narrative reports from forecast data. This system does not support storing reports with their models. Training/testing data : The only information about what subsets of the core data were used for different ML stages (e.g. training vs testing) will be stored in narrative format in the project description. Reproducibility : Since this system stores data involved in forecasts and not source code, information about how to re-run models is only captured in narrative form in the model's description, and is linked to by the model's url field. Funding \u00b6 This work has been supported by the National Institutes of General Medical Sciences (R35GM119582).

Each forecast is made for a particular time zero in the project, and contains some number of predictions , one or more for each combination of the project's units and targets . Zoltar supports the following five prediction types, which we've found covers many forecasting applications. All predictions must pass a number of validity checks as documented in Validation . Each section has an example as represented in Zoltar's JSON format which was taken from the \"Docs Example Project\" demo project. Point predictions \u00b6 Point predictions represent a single value. See here for details. In this example we see a prediction of 2.1 for the unit \"location1\" and target \"pct next week\". Note that, like all predictions, the data type (in this case the float 2.1 ) must match the target's data type. (In this case it does; \"pct next week\" is a discrete target.) {\"unit\": \"location1\", \"target\": \"pct next week\", \"class\": \"point\", \"prediction\": { \"value\": 2.1 } Named distributions \u00b6 Named distributions represent distributions like normal , log normal , gamma , etc. See here for details.

Here's the configuration file from the \"Docs Example Project\" demo project: zoltar-project-config.json . Project configuration files contain eight metadata keys ( \"name , \"is_public\" , \"description\" , \"home_url\" , \"logo_url\" , \"core_data\" , \"time_interval_type\" , \"visualization_y_label\" ), plus three keys that are lists of objects ( \"units\" , \"targets\" , and \"timezeros\" ). The metadata values' meanings are self-evident except for these two: time_interval_type : Used by the D3 component to label the X axis, is either Week , Biweek , or Month visualization_y_label : \"\" Y axis, can be any text Here are the three list objects' formats: \"units\" : a list of objects containing only one field: name : The name of the unit. \"targets\" : a list of the project's targets. Please see the Targets.md file for a detailed description of target parameters and which are required. Here are all possible parameters that can be passed in a project configuration file: name : string description : string type : string - must be one of the following: continuous , discrete , nominal , binary , or date is_step_ahead : boolean step_ahead_increment : integer - negative, zero, or positive unit : string range : an array (list) of two numbers cats : an array (list) of one or more numbers or strings (which depends on the target's type's data type) dates : an array (list) of one or more strings in the YYYY-MM-DD format \"timezeros\" : a list of the projects time zeros. Each has these fields: timezero_date : The timezero's date in yyyymmdd format data_version_date : Optional data version date in the same format. Pass null if the timezero does not have one is_season_start : true if this starts a season, and false otherwise season_name : Applicable when is_season_start is true , names the season, e.g., \"2010-2011\" Truth data format (CSV) \u00b6 Every project in Zoltar can have ground truth values associated with targets. This information is required for Zoltar to do scoring. Users can access them as CSV as described in Truth . An example truths file is zoltar-ground-truth-example.csv . The file has four columns: timezero , unit , target , value : timezero : date the truth applies to, formatted as yyyy-mm-dd unit : the unit's name target : target name value : truth value, formatted according to the target's type. date values are formatted yyyy-mm-dd and booleans as true or false Score download format (CSV) \u00b6 Zoltar calculates scores for all projects in the archive if they meet the requirements specified in Scoring . Users can download them as CSV through the web UI. The file has five fixed columns plus one column for each implemented score . Score names are in the header.

This format is strongly inspired by https://github.com/cdcepi/predx/blob/master/predx_classes.md . See zoltar-predictions-examples.json for an example. The file contains a top-level with two keys: \"meta\" and \"predictions\" . The meta section is unused for uploads, and for downloads contains various information about the forecast in the repository in the \"forecast\" field) plus lists of the project's \"units\" and \"targets\" . The \"predictions\" list contains objects for each prediction, and each object contains the following four keys: \"location\" : name of the Location. \"target\" : name of the Target. \"class\" : the type of prediction this is. It is an abbreviation of the corresponding Prediction subclass - the names are : bin , named , point , and sample . \"prediction\" : a class-specific dict containing the prediction data itself. The format varies according to class. Here is a summary (see Data model for details and examples): \"bin\" : Binned distribution with a category for each bin. It is a two-column table represented by two keys, one per column: cat and prob . They are paired, i.e., have the same number of rows. \"named\" : A named distribution with four fields: family and param1 through param3 . family names must be one of : norm , lnorm , gamma , beta , bern , binom , pois , nbinom , and nbinom2 . \"point : A numeric point prediction with a single value key. \"sample\" : Numeric samples represented as a table with one column that is found in the sample key. Quantile forecast format (CSV) \u00b6 Zoltar libraries support importing quantile data (see Validation.md for more information) via the COVID-19 CSV format documented at covid19-forecast-hub . While this format is not supported by Zoltar itself (i.e., you cannot upload one directly - you must always upload JSON files in the above format ), the libraries allow you to translate between the two. Columns: The Zoltar libraries ignore all but the following, which are allowed to be in any order: \"target\" : a unique id for the target \"location\" : a unique id for the location (we have standardized to FIPS codes ). It is translated to Zoltar's \"unit\" concept. \"type\" : one of either \"point\" or \"quantile\" \"quantile\" : a value between 0 and 1 (inclusive), stating which quantile is displayed in this row. if type==\"point\" then NA. \"value\" : a numeric value representing the value of the quantile function evaluated at the probability specified in quantile See quantile-predictions.csv for an example.","title":"File Formats"},{"location":"FileFormats/#file-formats","text":"Zoltar uses a number of formats for representing truth data, forecasts, configurations, etc. This page documents those.

The metadata values' meanings are self-evident except for these two: time_interval_type : Used by the D3 component to label the X axis, is either Week , Biweek , or Month visualization_y_label : \"\" Y axis, can be any text Here are the three list objects' formats: \"units\" : a list of objects containing only one field: name : The name of the unit. \"targets\" : a list of the project's targets. Please see the Targets.md file for a detailed description of target parameters and which are required. Here are all possible parameters that can be passed in a project configuration file: name : string description : string type : string - must be one of the following: continuous , discrete , nominal , binary , or date is_step_ahead : boolean step_ahead_increment : integer - negative, zero, or positive unit : string range : an array (list) of two numbers cats : an array (list) of one or more numbers or strings (which depends on the target's type's data type) dates : an array (list) of one or more strings in the YYYY-MM-DD format \"timezeros\" : a list of the projects time zeros.

Upload a forecast \u00b6 Here we show how to upload forecast data into Zoltar. It is important to know that Zoltar enqueues long operations like forecast uploading, which keeps the site responsive but makes uploading a little more complicated. Rather than having the upload feature block until the upload is done, you instead get a quick response in the form of an upload file job detail page that shows the status of your upload. This page is described in Check an upload's status below. Forecasts are uploaded to a particular model for a particular time zero. To upload one: Go to the model detail page of the one you want to upload into. Find the time zero that the forecast is associated with. If the time zero already has a forecast then delete it (see Delete a forecast below). You can tell if a time zero has an uploaded forecast in two ways: the text in the \"Data Source\" column is a link instead of the words \"(No data)\" and the icon in the \"Action\" column is a red trash can and not a green upload icon. Click the \"Browse...\" button in the time zero's \"Action\" column. In the dialog that appears, select a Forecast data format JSON file Click the green upload button. If the file is OK then you will be taken to an upload file job detail page that shows the status of your upload, with the message \"Queued the forecast file for uploading.\", where is your file's name. See Check an upload's status below for this page's details.

Currently the top looks like this: Project details table \u00b6 At the top of the page is a table showing this information related to the project: Summary : The same summary as on the home page: The number of models and forecasts in the project. Note that this may be an estimate. Owner : The user that has full control of the project, and includes authorization to view, edit, and delete anything (models, forecasts, etc.) The owner is the user that created the project (which is done on the home page). Model owners : A list of users who can view the project (applicable only if the project is private), and who can create and delete models, and upload and delete forecasts. The project owner specifies model owners when she creates or edits the project. Time Interval Type : Tells the D3 Foresight component what its x-axis label should be. Choices: Week, Biweek, or Month. Visibility : A project can be either public or private , which controls project visibility, including accessing data. Project owners set this when they create the project. Visibility applies to list and detail pages, along with API endpoints. Public projects are viewable by anyone, users and anonymous visitors included. Private projects can only be viewed by project owners and model owners. This means that in order to grant a user access to a private account, the project owner must add her to the project's model owners list, even if that user will not be managing any models. Description : Prose provided by project owner. It should cover these topics: Information about the \"real-time-ness\" of data, i.e., revised/unrevised. Details about how models interpret time zeros and data version dates. Data file naming scheme. Home : A link to the project's home page, which might include details about any competitions, source code, team members, included models, etc. Core data : A link to a page that contains data (e.g., CSV files) used to train models. For model competitions, it should include all data sets made available to everyone in the challenge, including supplemental data like Google queries or weather data. Ideally Zoltar users interested in re-running a project's models have all they need in the home and core data directories. However, they are not used directly by Zoltar. Truth data : A data file containing target ground truth that the project owner uploads. This data contains observed target values for time zeros and locations in the project, and is a project-agnostic way to capture actual values that models predicted for. It is used to calculate scores, and to extract the 'actual' data used in the D3 component's TimeChart. See Truth for details. Analysis : Links to visualization and score pages. See Scoring for details. Forecast models \u00b6 The Models section lists the project's forecast models by name, with links to model detail pages (see details below). A model captures a team's prediction challenge effort, and includes forecasts for some or all time zeros defined for the project. (See Concepts for more about time zeros.) If you're a project owner or model owner then a \"New\" button is shown that takes you to a form for creating a model. Clicking on a model's name takes you to its model detail page . Units \u00b6 This section lists names of the units in the project. (See Concepts for more about time zeros.) These were defined by project owner when creating the project. Often units are used to represent locations or regions that targets apply to. Targets \u00b6 This section lists information about project forecast targets, which are a central Zoltar concept. See Targets for more about them. Like units, these were created by the project owner. Some of these parameters are optional - this table shows which apply based on target type. the table includes the following columns: Name : Self-explanatory. Description : \"\". Type : The target's type . Unit : E.g., \"percent\" or \"week\". Unit is used when previewing data, and when downloading it. (Be aware that it can be confusing having both unit objects as above along with a specific target's unit.) Step Ahead? : Shows two pieces of information: 1) Whether the target is a \"step ahead\" one, and (if so) 2) what the \"step ahead increment\" is. (Step ahead targets are used to predict values in the future, and are used by some analysis tools.) Range : An optional numerical range of acceptable values. Cats : Optional acceptable categories for binned distributions. Time zeros \u00b6 This section details the project's time zeros . (See Concepts for more about time zeros.) It has these columns: Time zero : The date from which a forecast originates and to which targets are relative (i.e. a \"2-week-ahead forecast\" is two weeks ahead of the time zero). Every forecast has a time zero. See Concepts for more about time zeros. Data version date : An optional piece of metadata for a forecast. If it exists, it is associated with a time zero. It refers to the latest date at which any data source used for the forecasts should be considered. If present, it can be used externally by system users to recreate model results by \"rolling back\" the core data to a particular state. # Forecasts : A count of the number of forecasts for this time zero. Starts Season : Shows two pieces of information: 1) Whether the time zero is starts a season (it is blank if it does not start a season), and 2) the season name itself (which indicates that the time zero does start a season.)","title":"Project detail page"},{"location":"ProjectDetailPage/#project-detail-page","text":"A project is the main element for representing a forecasting challenge.

Create a project \u00b6 There are two ways to create a project: by editing a form or by uploading a JSON project configuration file. Using a form is a quick way to make a project to get a team started, but is very limited in what can be specified, mainly the information in the Details table as described in the link above (name, visibility, time interval type, description, home URL, core data, logo url, and model owners). The second method - using a configuration file - is preferred as it allows specifying all aspects of a project. Both methods are accessed via the green \"New\" dropdown button at the top of the Projects page . To create a project via a form: \u00b6 Click the green \"New\" button at the top of the projects list and select \"From form...\" Fill in the fields and click \"Create\".

The update is performed only on models that have changed, i.e., those that have added or removed forecasts since the last update. Following are details about scoring. Scoring requirements \u00b6 For Zoltar to calculate a forecast's scores, the following must be true: Ground truth has been uploaded, and contains truth values for each unit/target combination in the forecast. Data is available in the prediction elements shown in the table Available scores by target type and prediction element . Current scores \u00b6 At the time of writing Zoltar implements these scores: Error : The the truth value minus the model's point estimate. Absolute Error : The absolute value of the truth value minus the model's point estimate. Lower is better. Log score (single bin) : Natural log of probability assigned to the true bin. Higher is \" \"better.\" More detail is here . Log score (multi bin) : This is calculated by finding the natural log of probability \" \"assigned to the true and a few neighbouring bins. Higher is better. See this page for how it works. Probability Integral Transform (PIT) : The probability integral transform (PIT) is a metric commonly \" \"used to evaluate the calibration of probabilistic forecasts.

Viewing scores \u00b6 Scores are accessed from the project detail page of the project of interest via the links in the Analysis row in the project details table at the top of the page. There are three links: Visualizations : Takes you to a page that shows a time chart of the project's predictions. See the visualization page for details. Aggregate scores : Goes to the \"Mean Absolute Error\" page. Absolute error is the absolute value of difference between the eventually observed value and the point prediction.

In Zoltar, a single forecast made by a model may give predictions for multiple targets. For example, a single forecast might include a forecast of 1- and 2-week-ahead values and a prediction of when the time series will reach its maximum in a given period of time. When a project is created, the project owner specifies which targets should be part of any submitted forecast. As we will see below, targets have specific properties, and there are several different types of targets that determine which properties and features pertain to a particular target. Target types \u00b6 continuous : A quantitative target whose range encapsulates a section of the real number line. Examples: percentage of all doctors' office visits due to influenza like-illness, or disease incidence per 100,000 population. discrete : A quantitative target whose range is a set of integer values. Example: the number of incident cases in a time period. nominal : A nominal, unordered categorical target. Example: severity level in categories of \"low\", \"moderate\", and \"high\". binary : A binary target, with a defined outcome that can be seen as a true/false. Example: does the maximum value of a variable exceed some threshold C in a given period of time. date : A target with a discrete set of calendar dates as possible outcomes. Example: the calendar week in which peak incidence occurs (represented by the Sunday of that week. Target parameters \u00b6 When created, all targets have a set of parameters that must be defined. Each type of target then has a set of additional, sometimes, optional parameters. These are all defined below. Summary of allowed, optional, and required parameters, by target type \u00b6 Here is a table that summarizes which are allowed, optional, and required, by type. legend: 'x' = required, '(x)' = required if is_step_ahead is true , '-' = disallowed, '~' = optional. target type type name description is_step_ahead step_ahead_increment unit range cats continuous x x x x (x) x ~ ~ discrete x x x x (x) x ~ ~ nominal x x x x (x) - - x binary x x x x (x) - - - date x x x x (x) x - x Required parameters for all targets \u00b6 name : A brief name for the target. (The number of characters is not limited, but brevity is helpful.) description : A verbose description of what the target is. (The number of characters is not limited.) type : One of the five target types named above, e.g., continuous . is_step_ahead : true if the target is one of a sequence of targets that predict values at different points in the future. step_ahead_increment : An integer, indicating the forecast horizon represented by this target. It is required if is_step_ahead is true . Parameters specific to continuous targets \u00b6 unit : (Required) E.g., \"percent\" or \"week\". range : (Optional) a numeric vector of length 2 specifying a lower and upper bound of a range for the continuous target. The range is assumed to be inclusive on the lower bound and open on the upper bound, e.g. [a, b). If range is not specified than range is assumed to be (-infty, infty). cats : (Optional, but uploaded Bin prediction types will be rejected unless these are specified) an ordered set of numeric values indicating the inclusive lower-bounds for the bins of binned distributions. E.g. if cats is specified as [0, 1.1, 2.2] then the implied set of valid intervals would be [0,1.1), [1.1,2.2) and [2.2, \\infty). Additionally, if range had been specified as [0, 100] in addition to the above cats , then the final bin would be [2.2, 100]. If both range and cats are specified, then min( cats ) must equal the lower bound and max( cats ) must be less than the upper bound of range . Parameters specific to discrete targets \u00b6 unit : (Required) E.g., \"cases\". range : (Optional, but uploaded Bin prediction types will be rejected unless range is specified) an integer vector of length 2 specifying a lower and upper bound of a range for the continuous target. The range is assumed to be inclusive on both the lower and upper bounds, e.g. [a, b]. If range is not specified than range is assumed to be (-infty, infty). cats : (Optional, and can only be specified if range is also specified) an ordered set of integer values indicating the inclusive lower-bounds for the bins of binned distributions. E.g. if cats is specified as [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50] and range is specified as [0, 100] then the implied set of valid categories would be [0,10), [10, 20), [20, 30), [30, 40), [40, 50) and [50, 100]. If both range and cats are specified, then min( cats ) must equal the lower bound and max( cats ) must be less than the upper bound of range . Parameters specific to nominal targets \u00b6 cats : (Required) a list of strings that name the categories for this target.

Below, we document the checks and tests that are performed on all forecasts. We first list the test that is performed for every prediction, and after that, tests are broken down by the class of prediction. Definitions \u00b6 For clarity, we define specific terms that we will use below. Forecast: a collection of data specific to a project > model > timezero. Prediction: a group of a prediction elements(s) specific to a location and target. Prediction Element: data that define a unique single prediction, specific to the class of prediction it is. Prediction Class: data structures representing different types of predictions, e.g. \"Point\" and \"Bin\" (see Data Model for more detail) Target Type: the classification for a specific forecast target, one of \"continuous\", \"discrete\", \"nominal\", \"binary\" or \"date\" (see Targets for more info) Database Row(s): the entry(ies)/row(s) in the database that comprise a prediction element. Tests for all Prediction Elements \u00b6 These tests are performed when a forecast is created or updated. The Prediction's class must be valid for its target's type (see Valid prediction types by target type . Within a Prediction, there cannot be more than 1 Prediction Element of the same class. Tests for Prediction Elements by Prediction Class \u00b6 These tests are performed when a forecast is created or updated. Bin Prediction Elements \u00b6 If a Bin Prediction Element exists, it should have >=1 Database Rows. |cat| = |prob| . The number of elements in the cat and prob vectors should be identical. cat (i, f, t, d, b): Entries in the database rows in the cat column cannot be \u201c\u201d , \u201cNA\u201d or NULL (case does not matter). Entries in cat must be a subset of Target.cats from the target definition. prob (f): [0, 1]. Entries in the database rows in the prob column must be numbers in [0, 1]. For one prediction element, the values within prob must sum to 1.0 (values within +/- 0.001 of 1 are acceptable). The data format of cat should correspond or be translatable to the type as in the target definition. NB: Rows for Bin predictions where prob == 0 are not stored in the database. Named Prediction Elements \u00b6 We note that Named predictions currently only support fairly simple distributions. We currently support distributions with up to three parameters. Future versions of Zoltar could support distributions with larger numbers of parameters. If a Named Prediction Element exists, it should have exactly 1 Database Row. family : must be one of the abbreviations shown in the table below. param1 , param2 , param3 (f): The number of param columns with non-NULL entries count must match family definition (see note below). Parameters for each distribution must be within valid ranges, which, if constraints exist, are specified in the table below. For reference, here is the mapping between the generic parameter names and the family-specific use of them (based on predx_classes.md ): Family abbreviation param1 param2 param3 Normal norm mean sd>=0 - LogNormal lnorm mean sd>=0 - Gamma gamma shape>0 rate>0 - Beta beta a>0 b>0 - Poisson pois rate>0 - - Neg.Binom1 nbinom r>0 0<=p<=1 - Neg.Binom2 nbinom2 mean>0 disp>0 - Point Prediction Elements \u00b6 If a Point Prediction Element exists, it should have exactly 1 Database Row for all targets. value (i, f, t, d, b): Entries in the database rows in the value column cannot be \u201c\u201d , \u201cNA\u201d or NULL (case does not matter). The data format of value should correspond or be translatable to the type as in the target definition. Sample Prediction Elements \u00b6 If a Sample Prediction Element exists, it should have >=1 Database Rows. sample (i, f, t, d, b): Entries in the database rows in the sample column cannot be \u201c\u201d , \u201cNA\u201d or NULL (case does not matter). The data format of sample should correspond or be translatable to the type as in the target definition. Quantile Prediction Elements \u00b6 If a Quantile Prediction Element exists, it should have >=1 Database Rows. |quantile| = |value| . The number of elements in the quantile and value vectors should be identical. quantile (f): [0, 1]. Entries in the database rows in the quantile column must be numbers in [0, 1]. quantile s must be unique. value (i, f, d): Entries in value must be non-decreasing as quantiles increase. Entries in value must obey existing ranges for targets. The data format of value should correspond or be translatable to the type as in the target definition. Tests for Predictions by Target Type \u00b6 These tests are performed when a forecast is created or updated. \"continuous\" \u00b6 Within one prediction, there can be at most one of the following prediction elements, but not both: { Named , Bin }. \"discrete\" \u00b6 Within one prediction, there can be at most one of the following prediction elements, but not both: { Named , Bin }. Tests for Prediction Elements by Target Type \u00b6 These tests are performed when a forecast is created or updated. For all target types, only valid Prediction Types are accepted. \"continuous\" \u00b6 any values in Point or Sample Prediction Elements should be numeric if range is specified, any values in Point or Sample Prediction Elements should be contained within range if range is specified, any Named Prediction Element should have negligible probability density (no more than 0.001 density) outside of the range. for Bin Prediction Elements, the submitted set of cat values must be a subset of the cats defined by the target for Named Prediction Elements, the distribution must be one of norm , lnorm , gamma , beta \"discrete\" \u00b6 any values in Point or Sample Prediction Elements should be integers if range is specified, any values in Point or Sample Prediction Elements should be contained within range if range is specified, any Named Prediction Element should have negligible probability density (no more than 0.001 density) outside of the range for Bin Prediction Elements, the submitted set of cat values must be a subset of the cats defined by the target for Named Prediction Elements, the distribution must be one of pois , nbinom , nbinom2 . \"nominal\" \u00b6 any values in Point or Sample Prediction Elements should be contained within the valid set of cats defined by the target for Bin Prediction Elements, the submitted set of cat values must be a subset of the cats defined by the target \"binary\" \u00b6 any values in Point or Sample Prediction Elements should be either true or false . for Bin Prediction Elements, there must be exactly two cat values labeled true and false . These are the two cats that are implied (but not allowed to be specified) by binary target types. \"date\" \u00b6 any values in Point or Sample Prediction Elements should be string that can be interpreted as a date in YYYY-MM-DD format, and these values should be contained within the set of valid responses defined by cats defined by the target. for Bin Prediction Elements, the submitted set of cats must be a subset of the valid outcomes defined by the target range. Tests for target definitions by Target Type \u00b6 These tests are performed when a target is created or updated. \"continuous\" \u00b6 if both range and cats are specified, then the min(cats) must equal the lower bound and max(cats) must be less than the upper bound. if range is specified it must contain two numeric values range lower bound must be smaller than the upper bound. if range is specified, is assumed to be inclusive on the lower bound and open on the upper bound, e.g. [a, b). \"discrete\" \u00b6 if range is specified, it must include two integers. \"nominal\" \u00b6 cats must be a character vector containing a set of unique labels of the categories for this target. The labels must not include \"\" , NA or NULL (case does not matter). \"binary\" \u00b6 none. \"date\" \u00b6 the unit parameter is required to be one of month , week , biweek , or day the date parameter must contain a list of text elements in YYYY-MM-DD format that can be interpreted as dates. Tests for ground truth data tables \u00b6 Please see this file for an example of a valid specification of ground-truth values. For all ground truth files \u00b6 The columns are timezero , location , target , and value . For every unique target - location - timezero combination, there should be either one or zero rows of truth data. Every value of timezero , target and location must be in the list of valid values defined by the project configuration file. (Note: not every combination needs to exist for the file to be valid.) The value of the truth data cannot be \u201c\u201d , \u201cNA\u201d or NULL (case does not matter). The value of the truth data should be interpretable as the corresponding data_type of the specified target. E.g., for a row corresponding to a date target, the entry must contain a valid ISO-formatted date string. Range-check for ground truth data \u00b6 The following test can be applied to any target with a range . This will always apply to binary , nominal , and date targets, as these targets are required to have sets of valid values specified as part of the target definition. If the range parameter is specified for a continuous or discrete target, then the following test will be applied to that target as well. For binary targets: - The entry in the value column for a specific target - location - timezero combination must be either true or false . For discrete and continuous targets (if range is specified): - The entry in the value column for a specific target - location - timezero combination must be contained within the range of valid values for the target. If cats is specified but range is not, then there is an implicit range for the ground truth value, and that is between min( cats ) and \\infty. For nominal and date target_types: - The entry in the value column for a specific target - location - timezero combination must be contained within the set of valid cats for the target, as defined by the project config file.","title":"Validation"},{"location":"Validation/#forecast-validation","text":"Forecasts stored in Zoltar are validated upon upload based on the expected structure of each forecast.
